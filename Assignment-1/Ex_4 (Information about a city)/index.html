                                            [laːˈɦɔːɾ] (listen)) is the second most populous in

                                            the world, with a population of over 13 million. It is
                                            the capital of the province of Punjab where it is the
                                            largest city. Lahore is one of Pakistan's major
                                            industrial and economic hubs, with an estimated GDP
                                            (PPP) of $84 billion as of 2019.[11][12] It is the
                                            largest city as well as the historic capital and
                                            cultural centre of the wider Punjab region,[13][14][15]

                                            situated in the northeast of the country, close to the
                                            international border with India.

                                            Lahore's origins reach into antiquity. The city has been
                                            inhabited for at least two millennia, although it rose
                                            to prominence in the 10th century.[19] Lahore was the
                                            capital of multiple empires throughout its history,
                                            including the Hindu Shahis, Ghaznavids, and Delhi
                                            Sultanate in the medieval era. Lahore reached the height
                                            of its splendor under the Mughal Empire between the late
                                            16th and early 18th century and served as its capital
                                            city for many years. The city was captured by the forces
                                            of the Afsharid ruler Nader Shah in 1739. Although the
                                            Mughal authority was re-established, it fell into a
                                            period of decay while being contested among the Afghans
                                            and the Sikhs between 1748 and 1798. Lahore eventually
                                            became the capital of the Sikh Empire in the early 19th
                                            century, regaining some of its lost grandeur.[20] Lahore
                                            was annexed to the British Raj in 1849 and became the
                                            capital of British Punjab.[21] Lahore was central to the
                                            independence movements of both India and Pakistan, with
                                            the city being the site of both the declaration of
                                            Indian Independence and the resolution calling for the
                                            establishment of Pakistan. It experienced some of the
                                            worst riotings during the Partition period preceding
                                            Pakistan's independence.[22] Following the success of
                                            the Pakistan Movement and the subsequent partition of
                                            British India in 1947, Lahore was declared the capital
                                            of Pakistan's Punjab province.

                                            Lahore exerts a strong cultural influence over
                                            Pakistan.[citation needed] A UNESCO City of Literature
                                            and major center for Pakistan's publishing industry,
                                            Lahore remains the foremost center of Pakistan's
                                            literary scene. The city is also a major centre of
                                            education in Pakistan,[23] with some of Pakistan's
                                            leading universities based in the city.[24] For many
                                            years, Lahore was home to Pakistan's film industry,
                                            Lollywood, though in recent years most filming has
                                            shifted to Karachi. Lahore is a major centre of Qawwali
                                            music.[25] The city also hosts much of Pakistan's
                                            tourist industry,[25][26] with major attractions
                                            including the Walled City, the famous Badshahi and Wazir
                                            Khan mosques, as well as several Sikh and Sufi shrines.
                                            Lahore is also home to the Lahore Fort and Shalimar
                                            Gardens, both of which are UNESCO World Heritage
                                            Sites.[26]
