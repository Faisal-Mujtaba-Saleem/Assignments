                    <p><strong> Round Table Conference </strong>, (1930–32), in Indian history, a series of meetings in
                        three sessions
                        called
                        by the
                        British government to consider the future constitution of India. The conference resulted from a
                        review of
                        the Government of India Act of 1919, undertaken in 1927 by the Simon Commission, whose report
                        was
                        published
                        in 1930. The conference was held in London.</p>

                    <p>The first session (Nov. 12, 1930–Jan. 19, 1931) had 73 representatives, from all Indian states
                        and
                        all
                        parties except the Indian National Congress, which was waging a civil disobedience campaign
                        against
                        the
                        government. Its principal achievement was an insistence on parliamentarianism—an acceptance by
                        all,
                        including the princes, of the federal principle—and on dominion status as the goal of
                        constitutional
                        development. The second session (September–December 1931) was attended by Mahatma Gandhi as the
                        Congress
                        representative; it failed to reach agreement, either constitutionally or on communal
                        representation.
                        The
                        third session (Nov. 17–Dec. 24, 1932) was shorter and less important, with neither the Congress
                        nor
                        the
                        British Labour Party attending. The result of these deliberations was the Government of India
                        Act,
                        1935,
                        establishing provincial autonomy and also a federal system that was never implemented.</p>
