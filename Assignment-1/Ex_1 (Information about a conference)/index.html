                                                <strong> Round Table Conference </strong>, (1930–32),
                                                in Indian history, a series of meetings in three
                                                sessions called by the British government to consider
                                                the future constitution of India. The conference
                                                resulted from a review of the Government of India Act
                                                of 1919, undertaken in 1927 by the Simon Commission,
                                                whose report was published in 1930. The conference was
                                                held in London.

                                                The first session (Nov. 12, 1930–Jan. 19, 1931) had 73
                                                representatives, from all Indian states and all
                                                parties except the Indian National Congress, which was
                                                waging a civil disobedience campaign against the
                                                government. Its principal achievement was an
                                                insistence on parliamentarianism—an acceptance by all,
                                                including the princes, of the federal principle—and on
                                                dominion status as the goal of constitutional
                                                development. The second session (September–December
                                                1931) was attended by Mahatma Gandhi as the Congress
                                                representative; it failed to reach agreement, either
                                                constitutionally or on communal representation. The
                                                third session (Nov. 17–Dec. 24, 1932) was shorter and
                                                less important, with neither the Congress nor the
                                                British Labour Party attending. The result of these
                                                deliberations was the Government of India Act, 1935,
                                                establishing provincial autonomy and also a federal
                                                system that was never implemented.
